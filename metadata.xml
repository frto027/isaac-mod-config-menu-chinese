    <description>这是Mod Config Menu的中文版本（中文字体+翻译api支持）
This is the Chinese version of Mod Config Menu.
If you don't speak Chinese, don't use it. [strike]No new features will be added to this mod, but [/strike]if someone else maintains the original version of MCM, I may follow in to ensure compatibility.

Chinese font support is added.
The translation API is added to the original logic.

I'm not the original author. Sorry but I don't have enough time to maintain the functions. Please don't ask anything other than the Chinese version here.</description>
